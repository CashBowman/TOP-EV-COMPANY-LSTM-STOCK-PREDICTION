# TOP-EV-COMPANY-LSTM-STOCK-PREDICTION
This code is a guide to using LSTMs for Stock Prediction on Electric Car Companies. The 5 EV Companies we examine are Tesla, Nio, Lucid, Rivian, and LiAuto. We create an LSTM Model
for each of these companies, then visually analyze the results using matplotlib. We end the project by creating a multivariate model with Nio, Lucid, and Rivian in order to examine
how the strong correlation of their closing prices will affect a multivariate model.

Here is a snapshot:\
